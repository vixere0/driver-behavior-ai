# Driver Behavior AI 🚗

This project analyzes real-world OBD-II vehicle telemetry data to classify driver behavior such as aggressive, normal, and eco driving using time-series machine learning models.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze noisy real-world vehicle telemetry data
- Perform time-series preprocessing and feature engineering
- Classify driving behavior using ML and deep learning models
- Generate a driver behavior score for each trip/driver

## 🧠 Problem Description
Modern vehicles generate large amounts of sensor data via OBD-II interfaces.  
This project aims to leverage this data to understand and model driver behavior patterns that are useful for:
- Insurance risk analysis
- Fleet management
- Automotive AI systems
